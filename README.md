## Project Status

## FAQ

**Can I use this on any Linux distribution?**
This script is specifically designed for Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.). Usage on other distributions is not supported and may cause issues.

**Why a separate repository?**
The original repository appears unmaintained. This fork exists to provide necessary updates and fixes while retaining credit to the original author.

**Is it safe?**
The script automates the installation of robust tools. However, adding third-party repositories always carries some risk. Use with caution and ensure you understand the changes being made to your package manager sources.
